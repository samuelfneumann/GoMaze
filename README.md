# GoMaze: Random Maze Generation for Reinforcement Learning in Go

GoMaze provides random maze generation for reinforcement learning in `Go`.
To start, create a new `Maze`, then use the `Step()` and `Reset()` methods
to take actions and reset the maze when the agent has reached the goal
respectively. Or, if you'd like to try the mazes with learning algorithms
already implemented in `Go`, see my [GoLearn](https://github.com/samuelfneumann/GoLearn)
repository.

You can even interactively play on `Maze`s in the terminal using the
`Play()` method.

## Algorithms

The following maze generation algorithms are implemented. Each has its
own [biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm),
which are important to take into account when learning on  these mazes:

1. Depth-First algorithms - biases towards long corridors
    * Backtracking recursion
    * Iterative
2. Uniformly Distributed Mazes - expensive to construct maze
    * Wilson's algorithm
    * Aldous-Broder algorithm
3. Binary Tree Algorithm - [diagonal bias](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/1/maze-generation-binary-tree-algorithm) with
two of the four sides of the maze being spanned by a single corridor.

## Maze Examples

### Backtracking

```go
m := gomaze.NewMaze(10, 15, gomaze.NewBackTracking(time.Now().UnixNano()))
fmt.Println(m)
